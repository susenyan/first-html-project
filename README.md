show what i learn about html
During last 2 months, I have read many books and have watched many vedios about html,css,javascript and PHP.But I still feel confused when I begin to make a website. I don't know how to arrange the files and many other questions occured. So I paused and began to think it is not a good way for a beginner to make a website as whole as I am not familiar to all the skills mentioned above. I decide to simple the project and afterwards enrich the content.

First step:a pure html file
I create a html file,adding 4 articles into it and of course some images ,titles ,tables

Second step:using css to make it beautiful
I add some css style in the html file. The style relocated the elements in the html file and now it looks more beautiful.

Third step:using database
I use mysql to store some information.
In the database 'demo1', there are two tables 'systemlist' and 'articlelist'.'systemlist' store the systemname, abbr and the image for the perticular system.'articlelist' store the article name, direction, and which system it belongs to.
Now,I want to show the articles stored in the database, so html is not enough, I have to use PHP.

In the php file,I learned how to connect the databse.Then read the items in the table. Next,open the .docx files and translate the content to string. Finally show in the html and css style just as what i have done in the second step.
