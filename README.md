show what i learn about html
During last 2 months, I have read many books and have watched many vedios about html,css,javascript and PHP.But I still feel confused when I begin to make a website. I don't know how to arrange the files and many other questions occured. So I paused and began to think it is not a good way for a beginner to make a website as whole as I am not familiar to all the skills mentioned above. I decide to simple the project and afterwards enrich the content.
